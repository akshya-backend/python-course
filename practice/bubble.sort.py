"""
Bubble Sort Algorithm in Python
--------------------------------
Idea:
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
This way, after each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end.

Time Complexity:
- Worst case: O(nÂ²) (when the list is in reverse order)
- Best case: O(n) (if the list is already sorted, with optimization)

Steps:
1. Compare arr[0] with arr[1]
2. If arr[0] > arr[1], swap them
3. Move to next pair, compare arr[1] with arr[2], and so on
4. After 1st pass, the largest element is at the last position
5. Repeat for remaining unsorted elements
